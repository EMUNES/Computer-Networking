- **Wireless hosts**. A wireless host might be a laptop, tablet, smartphone, or desktop computer. The hosts themselves may or may not be mobile.

- **Wireless links**. A host connects to a *base station* (defined below) or to another wireless host through a **wireless communication link**.

- **Base station**. A base station is responsible for **sending and receiving** data (e.g., packets) to and from a wireless host that is associated with that base station. A base station will often be responsible for **coordinating **the transmission of multiple wireless hosts with which it is associated, functioning as a link layer relay between the wireless host and the rest of the world with which the host communicates.
- **Network infrastructure**. This is the larger network with which a wireless host may wish to communicate.  

When we say a wireless host is “associated” with a base station, we mean that: 

1. the host is **within **the wireless communication distance of the base station.
2. the host uses that base station to **relay data **between it (the host) and the larger network. Cell towers in cellular networks and access points in 802.11 wireless LANs are examples of base stations.

The relationship between hosts and base stations can be in different modes:

- Hosts associated with a base station are often referred to as operating in **infrastructure mode**, able for routing and data assignment.

- In **ad hoc (mode) networks**, wireless hosts have **no **such infrastructure with which to connect. In the absence of such infrastructure, the hosts themselves must provide for services such as routing, address assignment, DNS-like name translation, and more.  

- When a mobile host moves beyond the range of one base station and into the range of another, it will change its point of attachment into the larger network, a process referred to
  as **handoff**.  

At the highest level we can classify wireless networks according to two criteria: 

1. whether a packet in the wireless network crosses exactly one wireless hop or multiple
   wireless hops.
2. whether there is infrastructure such as a base station in the
   network.

Now we can dive deeper:

- *Single-hop, infrastructure-based*. These networks have a base station that is connected to a *larger wired network* (e.g., the Internet). Furthermore, **all** communication is between this base station and a wireless host over a single wireless hop. The vast majority of our daily interactions are with single-hop, infrastructure-based wireless networks.
- *Single-hop, infrastructure-less*. In these networks, there is no base station that is connected to a wireless network. However, as we will see, one of the nodes in this single-hop network may coordinate the transmissions of the other nodes. *Bluetooth networks* (that connect small wireless devices such as keyboards, speakers, and headsets, and which we will study in Section 7.3.6) and 802.11 networks in **ad hoc mode** are single-hop,  infrastructure-less networks.  
- *Multi-hop, infrastructure-based.* In these networks, a base station is present that is **wired **to the larger network. However, some wireless nodes may have to relay their communication through other wireless nodes in order to communicate via the base station. Some wireless sensor networks and so-called wireless mesh networks fall in this category.
- *Multi-hop, infrastructure-less*: There is no base station in these networks, and nodes may have to relay messages among several other nodes in order to reach a destination. Nodes may also be mobile, with connectivity changing among nodes—a class of networks known as **mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs)**. If the mobile nodes are vehicles, the network is a **vehicular ad hoc network (VANET)**.
