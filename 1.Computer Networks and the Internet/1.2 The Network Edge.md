# 1. Access Network

## Home Access

### DSL

![DSL Internet access](images\DSL Internet access.png)

DSL is split from the phone line (**twisted pair copper wire)** and use DSL modem to **transform digital data into high frequency tones for transmission**

-  A high-speed downstream channel, in the 50 kHz to 1 MHz band  
- A medium-speed upstream channel, in the 4 kHz to 50 kHz band  
- An ordinary two-way telephone channel, in the 0 to 4 kHz band  

the three separate links above make DSL link available to deliver a phone call and an Internet connection at the same time

CO can control the rate(12 Mbps downstream and 1.8 Mbps upstream, and 55 Mbps downstream and 15 Mbpsupstream,  usually lower) to the residence. Also, **the speed rate will decline as the distance between the CO and residence increases**. If the distance is more than 5-10 miles, it’s time to change the way of Internet Access

### Cable

**cable Internet access makes use of the cable television company’s existing cable television infrastructure  **

the cable modem is typically an external device and connects to
the home PC through an Ethernet port  

The DOCSIS 2.0 standard defines downstream rates up to 42.8 Mbps and upstream rates of up to 30.7 Mbps , usually lower

In particular, every packet sent by the head end travels downstream on every link to every home and every packet sent by a home travels on the upstream channel to the head end. For this reason, if several users are simultaneously downloading a video file on the downstream channel, the actual rate at which each user receives its video file will be significantly lower than the aggregate cable downstream rate  

### FTTH

The simplest optical distribution network is called direct fiber, with
one fiber leaving the CO for each home. 

More commonly, each fiber leaving the
central office is actually shared by many homes; it is not until the fiber gets relatively close to the homes that it is split into individual customer-specific fibers.   

There are two competing optical-distribution network architectures that perform this splitting: active optical networks (AONs) and passive optical networks (PONs)  

PON![FTTH](images\FTTH.PNG)

In the PON architecture, all packets sent from OLT to the splitter are replicated at the splitter (similar to a cable head end)  

### Satellite

locations where DSL, cable, and FTTH are not available (e.g., in
some rural settings), a satellite link can be used to connect a residence to the Internet at speeds of more than 1 Mbps  

## Access in the Enterprise(home too)

a local area network (LAN) is used to connect an end system to the edge router  

Ethernet is by far the most prevalent access technology in corporate, university, and home networks

Even though Ethernet and WiFi(top 100Mbps) access networks were initially deployed in enterprise (corporate, university) settings, they have recently become relatively common components of home networks

## Wide-Area Wireless Access: 3G and LTE

Unlike WiFi, a user need only be within a few tens of kilometers(as opposed to a few tens of meters) of the base station  

# 2. Physical Media

- physical medium = guided media and unguided media  
- guided media: the waves are guided along a solid medium, such as a fiber-optic cable, a twisted-pair copper wire, or a coaxial cable  
- unguided media: the waves propagate in the atmosphere and in outer space, such as in a wireless LAN or a digital satellite channel  

## Twisted-Pair Copper Wire

two copper conductors twisted together, parallel

- Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) is commonly used for computer networks within a building, that is, for LANs (10 Mbps to 10 Gbps)

- twisted pair has emerged as **the dominant solution** for high-speed LAN networking(category 6a cable, can achieve data rates of 10 Gbps for distances up to a hundred meters)

## Coaxial Cable

two copper conductors twisted together, concentric

- can achieve high data transmission rates
- cable television systems have recently been coupled with **cable modems** to provide residential users with Internet access
- the transmitter shifts the digital signal to **a specific frequency band**
- Coaxial cable can be used as a guided shared medium. Specifically, a number of end systems can be connected directly to the cable, with each  of the end systems receiving whatever is sent by the other end systems.  

## Fiber Optics

a thin, flexible medium that conducts pulses of light, with each pulse representing a bit

- support tremendous bit rates
- immune to electromagnetic interference
- very low signal attenuation up to 100 kilometers
- very hard to tap
- preferred long-haul guided transmission media
- high cost of optical devices—such as transmitters, receivers, and switches

## Terrestrial Radio Channels

Radio channels carry signals in the electromagnetic spectrum

- require no physical wire to be installed, can penetrate walls, provide connectivity to a mobile user
- can potentially carry a signal for long distance
- The characteristics of a radio channel depend significantly on the **propagation environment and the distance** over which a signal is to be carried  
- Environmental considerations determine **path loss** and **shadow fading** (which decrease the signal strength as the signal travels over a distance and around/through obstructing objects), **multipath fading** (due to signal reflection off of interfering objects), and **interference** (due to other transmissions and electromagnetic signals)  

there are three groups of Terrestrial Radio Channels:

- operate over very short distance - Personal devices such as wireless
  headsets, keyboards, and medical devices  
- operate in local areas - the wireless LAN  
- operate over very long distance - the cellular access technologies 

## Satellite Radio Channels

A communication satellite **links two or more Earth-based microwave transmitter/ receivers**, known as **ground stations**. The satellite receives transmissions on one frequency band, **regenerates** the signal using a repeater (discussed below), and transmits the signal on another frequency  

- **geostationary satellite**: permanently remain above the **same spot** on Earth(placing the satellite in orbit at 36,000 kilometers above Earth’s surface), delay of 280 milliseconds and speeds of hundreds of Mbps  
- **low-earth orbiting (LEO) satellites**: much closer to Earth and do not remain permanently above one spot on Earth. To provide continuous coverage to an area, many satellites need to be placed in orbit
